"""
A wish list comprised of movies created by clients. What we mean by wish is intentionally vague as it is up to the
client to decide.

For example, one client may provide a service for keeping watchlists for their users: a list of movies a user wants to
watch. Alternatively, a client may provide a service keeping buy-lists for their users: a list of movies that the user
wishes to purchase.
