"""
A Profile. A generic grouping mechanism that can be used by clients to server
their end users. A client can have multiple profiles (read multiple grouping keys)
and use this however they wish to logically group wishlists.

Examples:
1. A profile could be a user, and the wishlists represent a user's wishlists
2. A profile could be used to group wishlists by genre, in which case a profile
id would be akin to a genre id
3. A profile could be used to group by popularity
